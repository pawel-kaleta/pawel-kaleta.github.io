“Farm Optimizer”, a tool for an MMO RTS browser game Tribal Wars written in **JavaScript**. The project is on hold at about 90% completion, as I’m currently not an active player and my level of engagement with the community does not justify further effort and time. The project involves reverse engineering an existing complicated codebase to integrate this tool with the game on both technical and user experience levels.

### Here’s some cool stuff I did:

-	complex, internationalized GUI integrated with the game both functionally and visually
- communication with a game server for data loading and performing gameplay actions 
- diverse gameplay calculations
- local data storing
