A germ of a game engine being written in C++ (ongoing). I believe, despite its early development stage, it **represents most accurately my current knowledge of C++ and coding principles and practices**. It allows me to constantly improve my programming skills by facing challenging problems from every aspect of game development.

## Here's some cool stuff I did:

- IoC (inversion of control) using layers stack
- Cross-platform OSI (operating system interoperability) abstraction layer: window, events, input
- Windows specific implementation of the above using GLFW
- Dear ImGui integration
- Debugging functionalities: logging (spdlog), profiling (Chrome event tracing tool), assertions
- Hybrid Actor/GameObject/ECS scene representation model - authorial architectural design (check out documentation folder in github repository)
- Simple 2D batch renderer in OpenGL
- Editor features: overall UI setup, viewport and camera, panels: performance stats, scene hierarchy, actor inspector, entity inspector
