A prototype of a small survival shooter game with a top-down view and 2D graphics written in C++. First bigger project after learning the fundamentals of programming. 
Written from scratch with no game engine using Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) for handling window, events, input and rendering.
I’m proud of being able to “reinvent the wheel” multiple times without closely following a tutorial.
