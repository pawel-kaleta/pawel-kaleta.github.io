“Resources Administrator”, a tool for an MMO RTS browser game Tribal Wars written in **JavaScript**. It is officially approved for usage by the staff of the polish version of the game and I keep updating and supporting it (v2.1.1.0 is live). It got quite the attention of the community and was received unanimously positively.

### Here’s some cool stuff I did:
- GUI integrated with the game visually
- communication with a game server for data loading purposes
- custom heuristic algorithm solving a particularly complicated variant of “the vehicle routing problem”
