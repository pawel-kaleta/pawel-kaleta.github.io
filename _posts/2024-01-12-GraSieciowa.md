Simple, top-down view dueling shooter game for two players via LAN written in C++. I created my own (lame, but working) technical solution for handling LAN multiplayer without any experience or guidance.

## Hereâ€™s some cool stuff I did:
- written from scratch with no game engine using Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) for window, events, input, rendering and network communication
- LAN multiplayer architecture
- graphics created through code, including dynamically rendered fractal in the background
