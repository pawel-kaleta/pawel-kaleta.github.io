### Hi!

I'm an ambitious, conscientious, eager-to-learn and self-taught, aspiring programmer with analytical prowess and some basic overall knowledge about game (engine) development.
I'd like to gain professional experience among experts on my way of fulfilling a dream of becomimg a recognizable game-dev industry veteran.

Games that inspire thinking, in either deep and meaningful or analytical and strategic way, were always drawing me in. I believe a game, with all its flaws and qualities, is a reflection of the team that worked on it. I admire the tight collaboration of unique talents from diverse specializations, that is required to create unforgettable experiences that are unique to the video game medium. I would like to get a chance of contributing in a direct way to this wonderful journey of creating those expiriences.

In my spare time I pursue my interests in various fields. Excluding the obvious, here are the few importan ones: works of J. R. R. Tolkien, climbing, pop culture, manga/anime, SC2 e-sport and basicly anything of substacial depth and complexity.
